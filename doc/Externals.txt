External Repositiories
----------------------

Currently external repositories are managed as git subtrees

git subtree add --prefix src/glfw https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git 3.1.2 --squash

The patches directory contains the necessary changes to integrate the original
library. Those changes are out of the subtree directory on purpose.

To compile apply the patches first.
